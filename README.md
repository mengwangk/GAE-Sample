Release 0.0.1 - May 26th, 2015
- Initial release.
- Users can login and logout. Once logged in, users can view their accounts under "Myspace".
- Users can view transactions related to their accounts.
- For 1st time login, dummy accounts and transactions will be created. Should not cause any slowness.
- Security control is through Google user authentication, to make it easy to deploy under GAE.
- Administrator is hardcoded to "crossovertest256@gmail.com". Password is "raspbian_1234".
- Lightweight framework. Refer to architecture and design document for more details.
- Administrator can view all available accounts under "Admin Panel". The grid can be used to group, filter and sort accounts. 
- TBD due to time constraint - admin search, view/download/print statement, money transfer. I am working full time and do not have that much time to work on this :(
